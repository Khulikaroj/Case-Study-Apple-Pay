### Technology and Advantage
 Apple Pay lets users make purchases in stores with their smartphones, using near-field communication (NFC) technology. A tiny antennain the phone transmits encrypted credit card data without consumers having to swipe their card. Apple Pay uses a security protocol — known as the EMV standard — that other mobile wallets don't use. The credit card companies Euro-pay, MasterCard and Visa first developed this standard in the 1990's and it's widely used in Europe, as well as other parts of the world.Credit cards that use the EMV standard are equipped with microchips that store sensitive data. These so-called chip-and-PIN cards are considered more secure than the "magstripe" credit cards used in the United States because card numbers and transaction details are encrypted before being sent to a merchant's computer, or point-of-sale terminal.
In the case of Apple Pay, EMV takes the form of a process known as "tokenization," according to John Shier, a security advisor with computer security company Sophos. Once you enroll a card, [Apple] doesn't actually store the card number itself on the device or on its own servers," Shier told Live Science. "They store a digital representation, or token, which is a 16-digit code that is meant to represent your card within the 'secure element' of the iPhone itself."

### Future
Apple Pay as of Oct 20, 2014, had 12 million active users- 1 million in the US within the first 3 days- 3 million in China in the first 2 days versus 5 million users in US & Korea in 6 months. Apple Pay is on pace to account for 10% of all global card transactions; Apple Pay currently accounts for 5% of global card transactions and that number will double by 2025.
While it may not seem like Apple Pay will monopolize card transactions any time soon, 5% is a big number considering the number of players in the space and many ways to pay. In the last three months of 2019, Apple’s service unit Apple Pay created $12.7 billion in revenue, which is a 17% increase from the same period a year earlier.
